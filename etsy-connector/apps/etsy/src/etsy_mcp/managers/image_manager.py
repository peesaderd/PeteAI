"""Image manager — wraps Etsy ShopListingImage endpoints.

7 operations:
- list: list all images on a listing (responses include alt_text)
- get: get a single image
- upload: POST multipart upload (file path or URL source)
- update_alt_text: try PATCH first, fall back to delete+reupload
- delete: DELETE an image
- reorder: PUT the full image rank order
- bulk operations are coordinated at the tool layer using update_alt_text

The most complex operation is update_alt_text. It first attempts a PATCH
request to the ShopListingImage endpoint. If Etsy returns 404/405 indicating
the endpoint does not exist (EtsyEndpointRemoved), it falls back to a
destructive delete + re-upload that preserves the original file content and
rank position. The fallback path is logged as a warning.

All operations return raw Etsy response dicts. Tool layer handles envelope
formatting and confirm gating.
