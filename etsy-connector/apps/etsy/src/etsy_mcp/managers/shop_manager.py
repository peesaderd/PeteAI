"""Shop manager — wraps Etsy Shop + ShopSection + ShopProductionPartner endpoints.

10 operations:
- get_me: return the authenticated user's own shop
- get_by_id: get a shop by shop_id
- get_by_owner_user_id: get a shop by its owner's user_id
- search: search shops by keyword
- update: fetch-merge-PATCH on a shop (uses real fetch + merge + PATCH)
- sections_list: list shop sections
- sections_create: create a new shop section
- sections_update: fetch-merge-PUT on a section (idempotent=True)
- sections_delete: delete a section
- production_partners_list: list the shop's production partners

All operations return raw Etsy response dicts. Tool layer handles envelope
formatting. Managers do not redact — EtsyClient already redacts in logs and
the tool envelope helpers redact in output.
