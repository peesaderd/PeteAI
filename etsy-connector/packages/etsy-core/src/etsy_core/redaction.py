"""F3 secret redaction — the defensive layer that prevents tokens and PII
from leaking through logs, error envelopes, or tool responses.

Named "F3" after the pattern established in godaddy-mcp-context/09-security-notes.md.

Critical rule: every log path, every error envelope, every tool response must
run user-controlled data through redact_sensitive() before emission. This is
defense-in-depth — the primary protection is never logging secrets in the
first place, but when that fails (and it will), redaction catches it.

#: Fields that should be redacted in all log output, error responses, and
#: tool envelopes. Expanded beyond godaddy-mcp's set to include OAuth tokens
#: and buyer PII specific to Etsy's transaction data.
#:
#: IMPORTANT — field selection rationale (Cycle 1 review fix):
#: - `user_id` and `client_id` are DELIBERATELY NOT in this set despite looking
#:   sensitive. Etsy uses `user_id` as the public buyer/user primary key across
#:   receipts, transactions, reviews, and users/* endpoints. Redacting it would
#:   gut every response that a caller explicitly asked for. The PII-adjacent
#:   identifier is `etsy_user_id` (a separate field), not `user_id`.
#: - `client_id` is the OAuth app identifier — public by spec, and Etsy also
#:   returns unrelated `client_id` fields in some contexts. Safe to leave.
#: - Only redact fields that are (a) actual secrets (tokens, shared_secret,
#:   Authorization header) or (b) unambiguous PII (email, first/last name).
