"""Token bucket rate limiter for Etsy API calls.

Etsy's rate limits (2026):
- ~10 requests/second per app
- ~10,000 requests/day per app

This module implements an in-process token bucket that enforces the
per-second rate and tracks daily usage. On startup, the daily counter is
loaded from disk and reset if it's from a prior UTC day.

The token bucket is shared across all tools in a single MCP process.
Concurrent MCP processes each have their own bucket (acceptable tradeoff
since the per-day cap is the bigger concern and that could be persisted to
a shared file in the future).

Design notes:
- Async-safe via asyncio.Lock
- Warns at 80% daily budget, refuses at 95%
- No circuit breaker (deferred to v0.2 per development/11-deferred-work.md#d-m02)
